```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```
Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        dst = k
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                dst += 1
            elif n == 1 and dst >= k:
                dst = 0
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
