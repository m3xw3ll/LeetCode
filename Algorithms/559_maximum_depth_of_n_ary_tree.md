# [Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/description/)

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by 
the null value (See examples).

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5
```
Solution
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: 'Node') -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        depth = 0
        for child in root.children:
            depth = max(depth, self.maxDepth(child))
        return depth + 1
```
