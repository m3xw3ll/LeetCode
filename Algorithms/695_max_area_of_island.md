# [Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally 
(horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```
Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int: 
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        area = 0

        def dfs(r, c):
            if r < 0 or r == row or c < 0 or c == col or grid[r][c] == 0:
                return 0
            grid[r][c] = 0
            return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)

        for r in range(row):
            for c in range(col):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area
