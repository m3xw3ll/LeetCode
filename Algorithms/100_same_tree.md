# [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```
Solution
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        if p is None or q is None:
            return False
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
