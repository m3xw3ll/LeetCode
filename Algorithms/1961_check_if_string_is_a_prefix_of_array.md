# [Check if String Is a Prefix of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-a-prefix-of-array/)

Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine whether s is a prefix string of words.

A string s is a prefix string of words if s can be made by concatenating the first k strings in words for some positive 
k no larger than words.length.

Return true if s is a prefix string of words, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]
Output: true
Explanation:
s can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode" together.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["apples","i","love","leetcode"]
Output: false
Explanation:
It is impossible to make s using a prefix of arr.
```
Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isPrefixString(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> bool:
        tmp = ''
        for word in words:
            tmp += word
            if tmp == s:
                return True
        return False
```
