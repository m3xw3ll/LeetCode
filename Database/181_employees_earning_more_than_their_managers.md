Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, name varchar(255), salary int, managerId int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3');
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4');
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', NULL);
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', NULL);
```

Table: Employee
```+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+

```
Solution
```sql
select e.name as Employee
from Employee e
where e.salary > (select f.salary 
                  from Employee f
				  where f.id = e.managerId)
```
