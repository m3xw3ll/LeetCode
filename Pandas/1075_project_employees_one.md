# [Project Employees I](https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-i/description/?lang=pythondata)

Table: Project
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
``` 

Table: Employee
```
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
``` 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50
```
Solution
```python
import pandas as pd


def project_employees_i(project: pd.DataFrame, employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    data = pd.merge(project, employee, how='inner', left_on='employee_id', right_on='employee_id')
    data = data.groupby(['project_id'])['experience_years'].mean().round(2).reset_index().rename(columns={'experience_years': 'average_years'})
    return data


if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 4]]
    project = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['project_id', 'employee_id']).astype(
        {'project_id': 'Int64', 'employee_id': 'Int64'})
    data = [[1, 'Khaled', 3], [2, 'Ali', 2], [3, 'John', 1], [4, 'Doe', 2]]
    employee = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['employee_id', 'name', 'experience_years']).astype(
        {'employee_id': 'Int64', 'name': 'object', 'experience_years': 'Int64'})
    print(project_employees_i(project=project, employee=employee))
```
